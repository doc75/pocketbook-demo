Our goals for this demo:

 * Deal with events related to touch
 * A bit of drawing on the screen, not full-refreshing it each time

Notable points:

 * Touch events seem to be `EVT_POINTER*` and not `EVT_TOUCH*`, at least on a TL3 5.14
 * A e-ink screen is really not the best when it comes to graphical applications ;-)
